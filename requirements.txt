This project is not an official Kali Linux repository. It is developed and maintained by a single independent developer. Until the official release of KaliGPT, you can integrate a well-known AI API key to get things working.

The code may currently be unstable or incomplete, but future updates will address these issues. For now, simply start the repository, enter your API key, and join the journey!
