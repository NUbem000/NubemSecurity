⚠️ **Warning: Do Not Install Yet**

This project is **still under active development** and not ready for public use.  
Please wait **1–2 Weaks** while the final setup is completed and tested.

I’m working hard to finish it 🙂 — once done, the **code and repo will be updated** with stable features.

If you still choose to try it early, that’s totally up to you —  
but please note that **@amarokdevs is not responsible** for any issues, bugs, or errors during this phase.

Thanks for your patience and support 💻🚀
