⚠️ **Warning: Do Not Install Yet**

This project is **still under active development** and is not ready for public use. Please wait **1–2 days** while we complete and polish everything.

I’m working hard to finish it 🙂 — once done, the code and repo will be fully updated and ready.

If you still want to try it early, that’s totally your choice —  
but please understand that **@amarokdevs is not responsible** for any issues, bugs, or problems you may face.

Thanks for your patience and support 💻🚀
